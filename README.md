# NFT Royalty Distribution Platform

## Project Description
The NFT Royalty Distribution Platform is a blockchain-based solution that enables creators to mint NFTs with customizable royalty distributions. Unlike traditional NFT platforms that typically support only single-recipient royalties, this platform allows multiple creators to receive royalty payments automatically based on pre-defined percentage splits when NFTs are sold in the secondary market.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a more equitable digital art ecosystem where collaborative work is fairly compensated. By enabling multiple creators to receive royalties from a single NFT, we aim to foster collaboration in the digital art space and ensure that all contributors are properly rewarded for their contributions to a piece. This platform bridges the gap between traditional collaborative art practices and blockchain technology, opening new possibilities for creative partnerships.
